# Quest

The commands are different types of challenges, like monsters or terrain.

You can increase your strength to perform more difficult tasks.

If you are not strong enough for a battle, you will be killed and will respawn at home or at an inn, keeping your gold and equipment.

There are different types of conditionals, based on strength, gold, or stack values.

Input is taken whenever you spawn/respawn, and it is added to your bag.

Charms are used as variables, and every charm that holds a nonzero value gives you 1 strength.

Once you are finished with any non-movement/conditional command, treat it as '+' for movement.

Execution stops when you hit a dead end or a `q` command.
